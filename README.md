# k2
This is kestrel rev 2.

Kestrel Rev 1 was a learning experience. There was a lot of code written that became obsolete as my understanding of the mechanics surrounding a chess engine evolved.

With that understanding, K2 is a fresh start, with a better understanding of what's needed.

Uses Cmocka (https://cmocka.org/) as a unit test framework.
